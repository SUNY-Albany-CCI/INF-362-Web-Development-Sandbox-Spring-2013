<h1>Johnny's In Class Assignment Week One<h1>

<p>My preferred method of learning is very tactile.  I actually took a "what type of learner are you test" in another
class this past week and found out I am a kinesthetic learner. Which makes sense because I need to feel, touch, and do 
to learn.  I am not saying I cannot learn other ways; this is just my preferred way of gathering information.</p>

<p>My discouraged practices in learning would have to be reading from a textbook or just listening to a professor lecture
all evening long. It is very discouraging because I get bored easily and I end up wanting to fall alseep.</p>
