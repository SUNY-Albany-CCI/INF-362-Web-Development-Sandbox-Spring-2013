					Below are the skills that I have developed over many years of 
					personal, work, and educational experience. These are the skills that I feel I bring to the table when I am asked what I can do.

						During my time at Adirondack Community college, now called Suny Adirondack, I gained a great deal of
						exerience working with Cisco equipment. I got to work with routers, switches, access points, servers, 
						and desktops. I learned how to configure all of the equipment I mentioned. We set up labs that simulated 
						office buildings located around the country and we had to make them work using specific protocols. All 
						were as close to the real thing as possible, the only thing missing was the hundreds of miles between the
						equipment. My instructor had day where she would intentionally mess up the network before class and when we
						came to class we would have to identify the problem and fix it. The problems she would cause could be as 
						simple as an unplugged cable, all the way up to changing addresses in the configurations of the routers and
						switches.
						<br/><br/>
						I feel that this experience has preapred me for handling actual networks. I feel confident in troubleshooting, 
						maintaining, and upgrading existing networks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some examples of protocols that I have had experience with are:
					</p>

						<li>RIPv2</li><input type="button" id="b1" class="btn btn-primary" value="Show Example" onclick="toggle('p1','b1')"/>

						<li>OSPF</li><input type="button" id="b3" class="btn btn-primary" value="Show Example" onclick="toggle('p3','b3')"/>

					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>
						This is one area that I am relatively new to, I have only been introduced to programming in my 1st 
						year of college in 2009. I started learning C++, which was realtively easy because many commands and logic
						follow english language. I felt that it was a good transition into programming. I eventually started getting
						more and more interested in web programming using languages like PHP, CSS, HTML, and Javascript. Web development
						really caught on with me and I feel I have a strong ability to create and maintain content within a webpage. I 
						also feel that I can design and build a full website with ease.
					</p>
					<h3>Known Languages</h3>
					<dl>
						<dt><strong>C</strong></dt>
						<dt><strong>C++</strong></dt>
						<dt><strong>Java</strong></dt>
						<dt><strong>MIPS</strong></dt>
						<dt><strong>JavaScript</strong></dt>
							<dd>
								For a simple example of this, all Show/Hide buttons on this page utilize a basic JavaScript function.
							</dd>
						<dt><strong>PHP</strong></dt>
						<dt><strong>HTML</strong></dt>
							<dd>
								This whole website was created by me using my collective knowledge.
							</dd>
						<dt><strong>CSS</strong></dt>
							<dd>
								The whole visual appearance of this website was created using CSS. It is a very flexible solution that allows
								you to make your website look and function just about any way you want.

				<h2>Computer Hardware:</h2>

					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>
						The image above is a picture of my main computer, one that I built years ago and have kept upgrading. One of the
						benefits to being able to build your own computer is that when you want to upgrade, only minor parts need to be 
						changed like the RAM or CPU. This keeps costs down because you don't have to upgrade to a whole new computer.
					</p>
					<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
					<p>
						I have had many years of experience troubleshooting anf maintaining all of my friends and families computers. They 
						have a wide range of different types of computers. They have laptops, tablets, smartphones, and desktops. In many 
						cases they have contacted me to fix their technology issues. Issues that I have dealt with in that past are replacing 
						laptop screens, upgrading RAM, replacing smartphone screens, software installations, hard drive recoveries, and the 
						list goes on.
					</p>
					<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
					<p>
						My best experience out in the work world dealing with PC hardware and software is when I got the opportunity to be
						technical support for a college convention for Empire State College. During this experience I was the designated tech 
						support person for each of the professors as they were giving their presentations and speeches. All professors used 
						laptops and projectors that I setup prior to their arrival. I then had to make sure that their presentation displayed 
						properly. Another responsibility of mine was to ensure that the audio equipement for their microphone and presentation 
						material was working correctly. This experience allowed my to test many of the skills I had learned throughout school.<br/><br/>
