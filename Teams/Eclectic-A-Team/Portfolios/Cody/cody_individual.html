					Welcome to my professional profile, this website contains all the information for you to make an educated decision to hire me for your company.

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I am a very driven individual with an interest in many different areas of technology. I have a great passion for learning, integrating, and improving
					technology. Anything related to technology always intersts me, which is why a position in the field of technology would be an excellent fit for me. 
					Although I am young, I have had more experience in my field than almost anybody. I started plying with technology as young as 5 years old and the obsession
					never really ended. My ultimate goal is to own my own company, which has one sole purpose, integrating technology into whatever the situation calls for.
