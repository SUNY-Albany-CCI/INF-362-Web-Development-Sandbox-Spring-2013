			<h1>Work Experience</h1>
			<div class="content_box">
				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Background</h2>
				<p>
					All of my work experience has been through internships during my last two years of high school and my first two years of college.
					Each internship tested the abilities that I acquired through my personal experience and through my education in school. 
				</p><br/><br/>
				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Internships</h2><br/>
				<h3>D.A. Collins Construction (<em>Assistant Network Administrator</em>)</h3>
				<p>
					Internship for Adirondack Community College. I was an assistant to the network administrator helping lighten the work load on 
					the current network administrator. I made visits to several office locations all over the state resulting in about 60 miles of 
					additional travel after arriving to the main office. I handled help desk for the main offices troubleshooting desktops, laptops, 
					switches, routers and printers. I performed maintenance on mostly HP printers, changing toner, print rollers and paper pads. 
					During this internship I learned skills in documentation and keeping track of IT assets when giving them out to clients.

				<h3>Cambridge Central School District (<em>Assistant Network Administrator</em>)</h3>
				<p>
					Internship for Adirondack Community College. I was help desk support for the entire school, any issues that arose before, during 
					and after the school day were handled by me. I was also in charge of inventory of new equipment. I gained more experience in using 
					Microsoft Windows Server. I also got a chance to manage and troubleshoot virtual desktop servers.
				</p><br/><br/>
				
				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Other Experience</h2><br/>
				
				<h3>Dell and Netgear (<em>Beta Testing</em>)</h3>
				<p>
					Testing a wide range of products including but not limited to routers, switches, and wireless devices such as wireless range extenders. 
					I am given deadlines to complete surveys and daily journals documenting my experience with each product. I currently do this when I get 
					free time.
