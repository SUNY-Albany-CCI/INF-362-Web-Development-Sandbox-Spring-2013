Preferred teaching: Hands on material. If the teacher invited guest speakers 
who are experts on teh subject matter
</p>
<p>
Discouraged teaching: Lecturing for hours, use of powerpoint only. Not showing enough
examples to prove what they're lecturing about.
</p>
<p>
Preferred learning: TBL has seemed pretty interesting to me so far. I like doing
homework, as it lets me teach myself.
</p>
<p>
Discouraged learning: I'm not really the biggest fan of reading multiple chapters
for an assignment. I hate bieng forced to read a journal. I'd much rather do it on my own time.
