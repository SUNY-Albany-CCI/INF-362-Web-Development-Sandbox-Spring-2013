<h2>Opinions on Teaching and Learning</h2>
<p>    In my opinion, the best teachers use a variety of techniques to engage students who may be different types of learners. If students were all the same, perhaps reading a textbook, or watching a Powerpoint presentation might be all that was needed to learn any material. In reality, learning is enhanced by texts, discussion, hands-on activities, video, individual and, even though (or perhaps because,) it can be uncomfortable, group participation. Despite the best efforts of even the most talented, dedicated and passionate educator, it is the students responsibility to learn. Motivation and willingness to work are important to fulfill that responsibility.</p>
