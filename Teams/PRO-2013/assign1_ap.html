var sentenceOne = "Personally I prefer to do more individual work than group work, but from what I have seen so far it seems as if the instructors have found a way to make it so that one doesn't outweigh the other. I like the fact that we will be working in diverse groups as in the the workplace this will also happen. I also like note taking and instructionals in class. I normally like to take a long time on my assignments so I do not really like in class work much. In class work normally causes me to rush through due to time constraints, however, for this class I do not think this will happen mainly due to the fact that it is a three hour class.";
