	<p> Ten Fun Facts About Ducks </p>

<ul>

<li>A baby duck is called a duckling. An adult male is a drake, while an adult female duck is called a hen or a duck. A group of ducks can be called a raft, team or padding.</li>

<li>All types of ducks have effectively waterproof feathers due to their intricate feather structures and a waxy coating that even when they dive underwater, their feathers stay completely dry.</li>

<li>Almost all of duck species are monogamous, which is the condition of having only one breeding partner, for breeding season but they do not mate for life.</li>

<li>Most drakes are silent and very few of them make a sound of "quack", but what they actually do are squeaks, grunts, groans, chirps and growls.</li>

<li>As soon as ducklings finish hatching, a female duck will lead them up to a half mile or more so as to find a suitable water source for ducklings for swimming and feeding.</li>

<li>All types of ducks are part of the bird family which is called "Anatidae" and ducks' species can be found worldwide on every continent, except Antarctica.</li>

<li>Ducks are considered as omnivorous and opportunistic eaters that they will eat grass, insects, fruits, fish and other types of food.</li>

<li>Ducks' feet have no nerves or blood vessels that means ducks never feel the cold when they swim in icy cold water.</li>

<li>Ducks always keep clean by preening themselves with their beaks that they also line their nests with feathers plucked from their chest.</li>

<li>Ducks were once wild until they were domesticated by the Chinese hundreds of years ago</li>

</ul>
