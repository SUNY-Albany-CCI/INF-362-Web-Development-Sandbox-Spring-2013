  The German shepherd is my favorite dog because it is one of the most popular dog breeds in the world. Besides being a common pet, it is also used as a police dog in many different countries. Its large variety of scents allows it to be a great tracking dog. As it grows up it becomes very strong and athletic. Because of its physique it is always willing to try challenging activities and exercises. Overall it is exceptionally intelligent, loyal, and versatile. Also when well-socialized and well-trained, it can learn and do almost anything.
