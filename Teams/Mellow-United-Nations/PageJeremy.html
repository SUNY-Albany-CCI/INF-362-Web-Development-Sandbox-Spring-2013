<h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>As a student in college for almost 4 years, I find that teaching methods in which students are
engaged in activities tends to work better. I don't really prefer group work but I'm always willing to
try things even if I don't like the idea of it. Lecturing and having students just sit for hours doesn't seem
to work well in my experience of trying to learn in those types of classes.</p>
