            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in a Second Bachelor's degree program for Computer Science at Univeristy at Albany.  I graduated last may from Morrisville State
				College with a 3.88GPA and aBachelor's of Technology degree in Application Software Development.  I am a SUNY Chancellor's Award winner as well as a member of ODK and PTK.</p>

                        
            <h1>What am I doing in Albany?</h1>
				<p>Morrisville's program was essentially a trade school for software development.  You learned how to copy code and paste things together, but you never really learned how it all worked.
				I wanted to get into programming at a lower level so I planned to obtain a graduate degree in Computer Science.  However, first I needed to make up a lot of math and basic Comp Sci courses.  
				Initially I was told this would take about 1-1.5 years to complete.  Upon scheduling all my classes I was given a new estimate of 2-2.5 years.  This being too long for my liking
				I accepted a job offer for after the Spring semester where I can work to pay off my student loans as well as have my employer pay for graduate classes.</p>

                        
            <h1>Why take such an unusual path?</h1>
            <p>The above only describes the crucial portion of my awkward times as a college student.  With my current resume I have been given many job offers, some of which were above what 
			my fellow Morrisville graduates could expect as a recent graduate.  Many have asked why I didn't just accept one of the offers when they were given to me?  Easy, I wanted more, I wanted better. I didn't 
			want to be a code monkey like those around me.  So I worked hard and took a risk that paid off.  I have landed a great job with awesome pay and very, very cool toys to work with ^.^</p>
			
			<h1>Why take a web design class?</h1>
			<p class="no_margin">I have always been curious about web technologies (and web design in paticular) as it wasn't a part of my ciriculum at Morrisville.  I have also lost out on many opportunities to make some extra cash
			from people wanting some sites developed. In addition the interesting possibilites of HTML5 have piqued my curiosity and I wanted to play around with its new features.</p>
