<h2>LIBERTY RECIPES</h2>
<p><span class="contentfont">Liberty Recipes is a website that I made for a class as a final project. The class was INF 201 Intro to Web Technologies. Throughout the semester  we learned about creating webpages using html, css, and JavaScript. I wanted my website to have a professional look and feel, which resulted in a final product that I am really proud of.</span></p>
<p><span class="contentfont">Click on the image to take a look at the website and maybe even try out some of the delicious recipes. Enjoy!</span></p>

<h2>LAB 3</h2>
    <p><span class="contentfont">Lab 3 was the first fully functional website that I made. It includes lots of beginner  webdesign elements, but also has some crafty features.</span></p>
    <p><span class="contentfont">Click on the image to visit my Lab 3 webpage. Through the navigation  bar you can also excess some of my first web design projects.</span></p>

    <h2>EXCEL SPREADSHEET</h2>
    <p><span class="contentfont">On the left is an image of an excel spreadsheet project that I worked on. This project required me to set up a spreadsheet that could be used to store the grades of my classmates.</span></p>
    <p><span class="contentfont">The spreadsheet required me to use functions and equations that could easily average student test scores and show if the student's progress is satisfactory. Since this is a large spreadsheet, the design was important. I had to make it look appealing to the eye while making it easy to navigate and understand.</span></p>

  <h2>MICROSOFT ACCESS DATABASE</h2>
    <p><span class="contentfont">While taking INF 202 Intro to Data and Databases, I created this database for my final project. The task was to create relational   database implementing  the tools that we used throughout the semester.</span></p>
    <p><span class="contentfont">The most important part of this database is the relationship between the entities. The attributes in each entity had to be linked so a person can easily run a query  using SQL. This would provide them an option to view the data attributes that they desire.</span></p>
