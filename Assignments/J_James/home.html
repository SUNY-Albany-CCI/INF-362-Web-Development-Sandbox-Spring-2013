<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Johnny James Jr. and I am currently a senior at the Univeristy of Albany, majoring in information science with a minor in mathematics.  I was born and raised in Harlem, New York City. </p>
<p>From an early age I didn't really see myself wanting to be a tech guy but I always knew I have a knack for it since I built robots in school. As a young child I wanted to be a pediatrician - it was something about curing and treating kids, at that time my age, that attracted me to that field.  I later found out the amount of schooling needed and quickly switched over to an accountant.  Numbers, and math was my thing.  Then I went to business camp, and realized that wasn't really for me.  However, in that camp, I held a mock position of CTO for Netflix and absolutely loved it. </p>
<p>That led me to actually want to get more into computers.  When I got into UAlbany, my major was computer science for the first two years. I switched over to information science because programming was too tedious.  It took ours of coding to see results.  With web designing, you could see progress within minutes.  That is what attracted me in the first place and why I am still striving for it. </p>
