<h2>Tiff James Deen</h2>
<p>Currently, I manage my friend's fashion blog TiffJamesDeen.com.  She is in no way technological savvy so I oversee what she does - well the tech side. I am responsible for making sure everything is aligned, all the fonts are cohesive and making sure the website in general is cohesive; with little help from blogger.  Besides the tech side I also am the guy behind the lens for the most part. Jack of all trades. And if you are readng this, *insert plug here*, check out <a href="http://www.TiffJamesDeen.com">TiffJamesDeen</a></p>
<h2>Youth About Business</h2>
<p>YAB conducts one of the most innovative leadership-training programs for youth in the marketplace today. The vision of Youth About 
Business is to provide an innovative training program to prepare youth to be successful in a business environment. Our mission is to expose 
youth to business theory and principles through our experiential learning model. We work primarily with high school students, and we serve 
a very diverse population of young people.</p>
<p>The YAB Summer Business Camp Program where students learn about the world of high level corporate finance through our Merger and Acquisition
simulation. Students are advised by attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and many other executives to understand the mechanics of these 
business transactions. Our "summer intensive" camps serve as the entry point into the year round Youth About Business Leadership Development 
Program curriculum. The summer culminates with the Wall Street Conference for Teens in one of the most exciting financial districts in 
America.</p>
<h2>HEAF</h2>
<p>At the Harlem Education Activities Fund, we understand that for many underserved students higher education is the key to unlock opportunities and transform the trajectory of 
their lives.</p>
<p>From the time our students enter the program, we help them to develop a personal and social work plan to reach their college goals. Whether it is our middle school students taking college tours, our high school students traveling internationally for service learning, or our college students conferencing with corporate volunteers on what they'll need to ensure career success, we are with them every step of the way - helping them to assume ownership of their school and career success.</p>
<p>We engage key community stakeholders, higher education partners, and a highly qualified staff to ensure that students who make the commitment to stay in public schools get all the support, access, and opportunities available to their counterparts attending non-public schools.</p>
