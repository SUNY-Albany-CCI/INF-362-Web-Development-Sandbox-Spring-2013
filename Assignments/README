This is Sarun's directory for assignments
=======

This directory is intended to host class assignments.

Please create a folder with your name and add your assignments to this folder.

To do that: (I will use dima Kassab as an example, please be sure to REPLACE that with your own name)

log in to your account using PuTTy. The host name is: 166.78.129.118
Authenticate yourself using:
>> exec ssh-agent bash
>> ssh-add ~/.ssh/[yourname]
for example, ssh-add ~/.ssh/Dima_Kassab

>> cd INF-362-Web-Development-Sandbox-Spring-2013/
>> git branch MyFirstBranch

I am assuming you have that branch? if not, do
>> git branch -b MyFirstBranch

then,

>> cd Assignments
>> mkdir Dima_Kassab (Replace Dima_Kassab with your name)
>> nano README

Inside this file write something like this is Dima's Directory, and then save the file.

Now you can add your directory through github:
>> cd  .. (this will take you to the parrent directory)
>> git  add  Dima_Kassab/ (don't forget to use your directory name instead of Dima_Kassab) 
>> git  commit  -m  "adding my directory"
>> git  status (This will show you what will be committed)

>> git  checkout  master
>> git  branch (You should see that "master" is the branch now)
>> git  pull  origin  master
>> git  merge --no-ff  MyFirstBranch
>> git  push  origin  master
